Crimify is an interactive data visualization dashboard built using Streamlit and Matplotlib to analyze IPC (Indian Penal Code) crime data across India from 2000 to 2012. This project enables users to explore crime trends at three levels: national, state, and district. It transforms raw CSV data into insightful visuals and statistics through interactive charts, key performance indicators, and tables, helping identify crime hotspots, yearly patterns, and major crime categories.
